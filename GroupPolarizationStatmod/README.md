# Group Polarization Generative Modeling

## Background

This code implements numerical analyses, generative simulations and statistical
tests described in the paper "Many claims of group polarization are plausibly 
false due to inappropriate statistics". 

## Code

### Simulate simple consensus group polarization data

Given a static latent mean, a pre-deliberation and post-deliberation
standard deviation, we can generate simulated simple consensus data to be fit
using either a metric- or ordinal-data statistical model. The metric model is
a t-test, which is equivalent to a linear model. The ordinal model is the 
ordered probit model, which accounts for the binning process that experiment
participants do when reporting their ordinal opinions.
