<p><em>Group polarization</em> is the name for a form of consensus where members of a like-minded group become, on average, more extreme in their opinions after discussing a topic. Group polarization is important because it may increase social and political tensions if moderates become more extreme. Decades of studies have replicated detections of group polarization, typically using an ordinal scale to measure opinions. However, these studies did not account for ordinal measurements, which can result in spurious detections of opinion change. Lacking original data we can still calculate the probability that a published detection of group polarization was spurious, i.e., to calculate the <em>false detection rate</em>. Across 54 group polarization experimental conditions from ten representative journal articles, we calculated false detection rates to be between 0.52 and 0.88, with a median of 0.75, using a generative model of group polarization experiments seeded with empirical data. We also use our model to develop experimental designs that achieve an acceptable false discovery rate. Much of group polarization research may be unreliable. This analysis can help change that by enabling others to avoid this hidden pitfall. More broadly this work demonstrates one important way that replication success alone does not imply epistemic reliability.</p>

<p>If an extremist’s opinion falls and it is measured with a Likert scale, will it make a noise? The answer had better be yes if we want to properly measure opinion change. Accurate measurements are critical for developing rigorous and reliable methods to promote more stable, sustainable, responsive, and efficient governments and institutions <span class="citation" data-cites="Mason2018UncivilAgreementBook Klein2020">(<a href="#ref-Mason2018UncivilAgreementBook" role="doc-biblioref">Mason 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-Klein2020" role="doc-biblioref">Klein 2020</a>)</span>. Unfortunately, social and behavioral scientists have often used statistical methods that distort opinion change when it’s measured on an ordinal, Likert-style scale (e.g.&nbsp;-3 indicates “Strongly disagree”, +3 indicates “Strongly agree”, and 0 is neutral) <span class="citation" data-cites="Liddell2018">(<a href="#ref-Liddell2018" role="doc-biblioref">Liddell and Kruschke 2018</a>)</span>. This includes a phenomenon called <em>group polarization</em> that former Obama White House official and law professor Cass Sunstein relied on to explain why “people become extremists” and why “political and cultural polarization” is “so pervasive in America”, as the publisher summarizes <span class="citation" data-cites="Sunstein2009">(<a href="#ref-Sunstein2009" role="doc-biblioref">Sunstein 2009</a>)</span>. Sunstein suggests group polarization research provides a “clue” to explaining how “facism…student radicalism…Islamic terrorism…[t]he Rwandan genocide…[e]thnic Conflict…acts of torture and humiliation by American soldiers at Abu Ghraib”, and more (p.&nbsp;1).</p>
<ul>
<li>We demonstrate here that there is a pervasive problem observed over decades of group polarization research where faulty statistical methods and incomplete reporting that should force the retraction of these studies from the canon. Effectively, then, empirical support for the theoretical concept <em>group polarization</em> stops being so: the epistemic integrity of <em>group polarization</em> is undermined with its empirical foundation losing mass.</li>
</ul>
<p>We complement this critical analysis with a prescriptive analysis to demonstrate that more appropriate statistical models do indeed lower the false discovery rate by committing fewer false positive detections of group polarization under a null model with shrinking opinion variance. Recently, statistical best-practice is to use Bayesian models of statistics, where social dynamics and opinion-reporting behaviors are represented as causally-dependent probability distributions, where a sample taken from one distribution (e.g., the opinion distribution of a group in a group polarization experiment) acts as an input parameter to another distribution (e.g., that represents the individually-heterogeneous distortion of opinions when reported on an ordinal scale). Our models follow current best practices in psychometrics, social science, and Bayesian inference <span class="citation" data-cites="Liddell2018 Kruschke2015 Rethinking Deffner2024">(<a href="#ref-Liddell2018" role="doc-biblioref">Liddell and Kruschke 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-Kruschke2015" role="doc-biblioref">Kruschke 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-Rethinking" role="doc-biblioref">McElreath 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-Deffner2024" role="doc-biblioref">Deffner et al. 2024</a>)</span>, but consolidate them in a new, useful way that enables the retroactive discovery of null model parameters that generate spurious group polarization, forcing published evidence for group polarization to be classified as non-identifiable, and removed from evidence that can be said to support group polarization.</p>
<p>Our methods can be turned on any data-driven social science analysis of data where participants report a latent, subjective psychological variable (mood, physiological state, etc.), and where various theories supposedly battle it out to best represent the phenomenon of interest via NHST performed on ordinal observations with weak, informal theoretical models to motivate the studies. This may just be the first of many bricks to fall since <em>all 68</em> of the articles that mentioned the word “Likert” and analyzed ordinal data used metric models to detect latent psychological variable change across three influential psychology journals, <em>Psychological Science</em>, the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General</em>, and the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="Liddell2018">(<a href="#ref-Liddell2018" role="doc-biblioref">Liddell and Kruschke 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This work is motivated by a core conviction that better thinking leads to better science. Theoretical clarity, careful measurement, and principled statistical modeling are not academic luxuries, but essential tools for empirical science. Theoretical and statistical confusions in the group polarization literature have lain dormant, undermining measurements of opinion change in group polarization unbeknownst to generations of researchers <span class="citation" data-cites="Brown1986">(<a href="#ref-Brown1986" role="doc-biblioref">Brown 1986</a>)</span>.</p>

<li>Many group polarization studies report opinion change based on pre/post differences, but assume a transparent mapping between observed scores and latent beliefs.</li>
<li>Yet ordinal opinion data can mask deeper structural ambiguities that invalidate these assumptions.</li>
<li>In what follows, we first describe the basic structure of group polarization experiments, then explain how ordinal measurement can lead to illusory shifts.</li>
<li>Finally, we introduce a null-consistency modeling procedure that operationalizes this insight, and show how it informs the credibility of reported effects.</li>

<ul>
<li>Most group polarization experiments follow a familiar structure: measure individual opinions, allow group discussion, then re-measure.</li>
<li>The central claim is that like-minded individuals become more extreme after deliberation.</li>
<li>Crucially, opinions are typically measured with Likert-style ordinal scales (e.g., from “Strongly disagree” to “Strongly agree”).</li>
<li>Analyses often treat these as interval-scaled, calculating mean differences and testing for significance.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-ordinal-continuous-mismatch-problem">The ordinal-continuous mismatch problem</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ordinal scores do not have a fixed interval structure — they represent ranked categories, not true distances.</li>
<li>A given change in score may reflect a shift in opinion, increased certainty, or both.</li>
<li>For example, if opinions become more tightly clustered (lower variance) post-deliberation, the group mean can appear to shift even when the latent mean remains unchanged.</li>
<li>This opens the door to <em>null-consistent detections</em> — apparent effects that emerge from measurement artifacts rather than real opinion movement.</li>

<ul>
<li>We formalize this concern using a generative model that holds the latent opinion mean constant while allowing variance to shrink.</li>
<li>The goal is to test whether an observed group polarization result could arise from such a stable-mean, shifting-variance process.</li>
<li>If this model can reproduce the pre/post measurement pattern, the observed result is non-diagnostic — it is consistent with a null hypothesis of no true change.</li>
<li>This is a form of constructive falsification: it doesn’t prove the effect is false, but shows it is not uniquely explained by change.</li>

<ul>
<li>Even if an effect is real, detecting it reliably requires statistical power — the ability to distinguish true shifts from noise or artifacts.</li>
<li>Studies using ordinal measures and small samples may be especially vulnerable to false positives under the null.</li>
<li>To assess this, we fit Bayesian ordered probit models to simulated data and estimate the power to detect effects of various sizes.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transition-to-empirical-review-and-fdr-estimation">Transition to empirical review and FDR estimation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Having established a model-based definition of null-consistent detection, we now apply it to published group polarization experiments.</li>
<li>By combining this logic with simulations seeded from published data, we estimate false discovery rates across conditions.</li>
<li>This isn’t a judgment about whether past detections were true. It’s a demonstration of how to estimate false detection rates properly—using models that actually fit the structure of the data. We calculate FWER and FDR for the original study designs at three effect size levels—small, medium, and large—based on Cohen’s guidelines <span class="citation" data-cites="CohenBook1988">(<a href="#ref-CohenBook1988" role="doc-biblioref">Cohen 1988</a>, Ch. 2.2.3)</span> and Bayesian methods from Liddell and Kruschke <span class="citation" data-cites="Liddell2018">(<a href="#ref-Liddell2018" role="doc-biblioref">Liddell and Kruschke 2018</a>)</span>. The verdict is clear: even if these studies had used better models, most still wouldn’t have had the power to rule out false positives. That makes replication a weak signal of reliability. If future group polarization studies want to produce meaningful result need stronger designs—and that starts with a clean break from outdated statistical habits.</li>
</ul>
<p>The null-consistency procedure functions as a test of model indistinguishability: it demonstrates that a reported group polarization effect could plausibly arise from a stable-latent process combined with changing opinion precision. This logic echoes foundational concerns in causal inference, where two competing models—one causal, one not—can imply the same observed data distribution and are therefore empirically indistinguishable without further assumptions <span class="citation" data-cites="pearl2000causality spirtes2000causation">(<a href="#ref-pearl2000causality" role="doc-biblioref">Pearl 2000</a>; <a href="#ref-spirtes2000causation" role="doc-biblioref">Spirtes, Glymour, and Scheines 2000</a>)</span>. In such cases, inference from observation to mechanism is invalid. Similarly, in psychometrics, it is well known that different configurations of latent traits and response thresholds can yield identical observed ordinal patterns, making the true structure unidentifiable without additional constraints <span class="citation" data-cites="borsboom2005measuring">(<a href="#ref-borsboom2005measuring" role="doc-biblioref">Borsboom 2005</a>)</span>. The present approach does not attempt to estimate the probability of false detection, but rather shows that under ordinal measurement, a null model can reproduce the observed pattern—rendering the result non-diagnostic of a true latent shift. This establishes a stringent standard: an effect must not only be detected, but shown to be incompatible with plausible null-generating mechanisms.</p>
