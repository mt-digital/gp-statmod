  \caption{\textbf{Opinion measurement model and spurious group polarization.} 
  Latent model participant opinions are drawn from a normal distribution with the
  listed parameters (A,C). The pre-deliberation latent distribution has high
  variance, but appears polarized when measured via integration (A).  The latent
  distribution's variance is expected to decrease during deliberation (B) via
  consensus, but in this example the latent mean is static, 
$\mupre = \mupost$. However, when the post-deliberation distribution is measured,
the simulated observed mean increases, i.e., spurious
group polarization occurs (C).}
