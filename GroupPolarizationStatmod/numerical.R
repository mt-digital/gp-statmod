# This module implements the numerical procedure to find what latent standard
# deviation results in the observed mean in the large N limit, given latent
# mean Âµ, the bin vectors, and thresholds.
#
# This estimation from the large N limit can then be compared with finite N
# simulations with N specified by referring to studies we review in our
# paper.
