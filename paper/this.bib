  ABSTRACT = {Group polarization is the widely-observed phenomenon in which the opinions held by members of a small group become more extreme after the group discusses a topic. For example, conservative individuals become even more conservative, while liberal individuals become even more liberal. Social psychologists have offered competing explanations for this phenomenon. These typically require questionable assumptions about human psychology. Here, we posit a more parsimonious explanation: the stubbornness of extreme opinions. Using agent-based modeling, we demonstrate that such "stubborn extremism" gives rise to group polarization, as well as other trends observed across the literature on polarization. Our study revealed a further methodological problem for the study of group polarization: reporting opinions as categories (e.g. on a Likert scale) inflates the observed increase in opinion extremity. We conclude with a call for deeper integration of opinion dynamics modeling with the cognitive science of communication and influence.},

  ABSTRACT = {Belief change and spread have been studied in many disciplines - from psychology, sociology, economics and philosophy, to biology, computer science and statistical physics - but we still do not have a firm grasp on why some beliefs change more easily and spread faster than others. To fully capture the complex social-cognitive system that gives rise to belief dynamics, we first review insights about structural components and processes of belief dynamics studied within different disciplines. We then outline a unifying quantitative framework that enables theoretical and empirical comparisons of different belief dynamic models. This framework uses a statistical physics formalism, grounded in cognitive and social theory, as well as empirical observations. We show how this framework can be used to integrate extant knowledge and develop a more comprehensive understanding of belief dynamics.},

  ABSTRACT = {Examines findings from research of the past decade concerning the effects of group discussion on decisions involving risk. Questions are raised about the basic assumptions that have guided research. Evidence that the items of the choice dilemmas questionnaire (cdq) produce systematically different responses both before and after group discussion casts serious doubt on the propriety of using cdq scores as measures of a unitary disposition to take risks. The conclusion that groups are invariably riskier than individuals is no longer justified. The risky-shift paradigm has generated an impressive body of facts which reveal the inadequacy of the paradigm itself. The central task for theory is not to explain "the risky shift," but to account for the much more complicated effects of group discussion. The attainment of a proper understanding of these effects will require the use of theoretical orientations and the collection of data that focus much more closely than in the past on the concrete properties of the decision-making process and the exact way in which group discussion affects them.

@ARTICLE{Burnstein1973,
  ABSTRACT = {One class of theories explains group induced shifts in individual choice in terms of interpersonal comparison process. By comparing himself with others a member finds out that his position is uncomfortably discrepant, e.g., he is overly cautious or overly risky. Knowledge of this discrepancy presumably is necessary and sufficient to induce him to change his initial choice. Another class of theories holds that merely knowing one is different from others is unimportant. Shifts in choice occur because during discussion a member is exposed to persuasive arguments which prior to discussion were not available to him. Two experiments were conducted, the results of which give considerable support to persuasive-argument theories and none to those based on interpersonal comparison: When a member did not know whether others were arguing for their own position or were forced to support a position contrary to the one they had originally chosen, and the former in fact was the case, typical shifts in choice were obtained. However, if a member had to argue for a position contrary to the one he had initially chosen (and thus he would not be able to muster highly persuasive arguments) typical shifts did not occur, even though another's initial choice could be accurately inferred. {©} 1973.},

@ARTICLE{Burnstein1975,
  ABSTRACT = {Small shifts in choice occur even without discussion, when individuals merely know each other's preference. This appears to support an interpersonal comparison explanation of group induced shifts in choice and to refute explanations based on persuasive argumentation. The present study demonstrates the contrary, that such effects are consistent with the persuasive-arguments formulation and are obtained under particular conditions specified only by the latter theory, to wit: Knowledge of other's choices is assumed to lead a person to think of reasons (arguments) others might have had for their choices-reasons which ordinarily would not come to mind without this knowledge. Such reasoning functions in the same way as persuasive argumentation during group discussion; it causes the person to persuade himself that an alternative course of action now has greater merit than the one he initially preferred. To test this analysis, an experiment was performed in which subjects responded to choice-dilemma items under three different conditions: Following their own choice (I) they learned what several others had chosen and then wrote arguments in support of alternatives given in that same item; (II) they learned what several others had chosen and then wrote arguments in support of alternatives given in a different item; and (III) they received no information about others' choices but merely wrote arguments on that item. As predicted, shifts in choice occurred only if the person knew what others chose and had an opportunity to think about the latter (condition I); they did not occur if an opportunity to think of others' choices was denied (condition II), nor if knowledge of others' choices was withheld (condition III). Content analysis of the arguments subjects produced in conditions I and II completely supported the hypothesis, as did analyses of responses to postexperimental questionnaire which directly asked the subjects about their feelings and thoughts upon learning what others had chosen. {©} 1975.},

@ARTICLE{Abrams1990,
  ABSTRACT = {We contrast two theoretical approaches to social influence, one stressing interpersonal dependence, conceptualized as normative and informational influence (Deutsch & Gerard, 1955), and the other stressing group membership, conceptualized as self‐categorization and referent informational influence (Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher & Wetherell, 1987). We argue that both social comparisons to reduce uncertainty and the existence of normative pressure to comply depend on perceiving the source of influence as belonging to one's own category. This study tested these two approaches using three influence paradigms. First we demonstrate that, in Sherif's (1936) autokinetic effect paradigm, the impact of confederates on the formation of a norm decreases as their membership of a different category is made more salient to subjects. Second, in the Asch (1956) conformity paradigm, surveillance effectively exerts normative pressure if done by an in‐group but not by an out‐group. In‐group influence decreases and out‐group influence increases when subjects respond privately. Self‐report data indicate that in‐group confederates create more subjective uncertainty than out‐group confederates and public responding seems to increase cohesiveness with in‐group — but decrease it with out‐group — sources of influence. In our third experiment we use the group polarization paradigm (e.g. Burnstein & Vinokur, 1973) to demonstrate that, when categorical differences between two subgroups within a discussion group are made salient, convergence of opinion between the subgroups is inhibited. Taken together the experiments show that self‐categorization can be a crucial determining factor in social influence. 1990 The British Psychological Society},

These results challenged 2 widely held assumptions: (1) that group judgments are less extreme than individual judgments, and (2) that the "risky shift" phenomenon is a content-bound exception to the averaging tendency of the group. A reinterpretation of available data suggests that a normative commitment may be the underlying variable responsible for polarization effects. (34 ref.)

  ABSTRACT = {Self-categorization proponents (e.g., Turner, 1991) assume that group polarization occurs because discussants wish to differentiate themselves from outgroup positions and implicitly think of such groups even when they are not specifically mentioned. Ingroup/outgroup salience is thought to heighten such effects. To examine this view, we had participants discuss Choice Dilemma items either with or without explicit knowledge of outgroup positions. Contrary to a self-categorization account, this manipulation of outgroup salience did not affect the degree of group polarization. In addition, rating measures revealed little spontaneous consideration of outgroup positions on the part of participants, nor was consideration of outgroup positions related to degree of polarization. Group members did show evidence of ingroup identification, but this identification was unrelated to participants' post-discussion conformity to the group consensus. Taken as a whole, these results suggest distinct limits to the self-categorization interpretation of group polarization involving Choice Dilemmas. Copyright {©} 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

@ARTICLE{Yarkoni2022,
  ABSTRACT = {Most theories and hypotheses in psychology are verbal in nature, yet their evaluation overwhelmingly relies on inferential statistical procedures. The validity of the move from qualitative to quantitative analysis depends on the verbal and statistical expressions of a hypothesis being closely aligned - that is, that the two must refer to roughly the same set of hypothetical observations. Here, I argue that many applications of statistical inference in psychology fail to meet this basic condition. Focusing on the most widely used class of model in psychology - the linear mixed model - I explore the consequences of failing to statistically operationalize verbal hypotheses in a way that respects researchers' actual generalization intentions. I demonstrate that although the random effect formalism is used pervasively in psychology to model intersubject variability, few researchers accord the same treatment to other variables they clearly intend to generalize over (e.g., stimuli, tasks, or research sites). The under-specification of random effects imposes far stronger constraints on the generalizability of results than most researchers appreciate. Ignoring these constraints can dramatically inflate false-positive rates, and often leads researchers to draw sweeping verbal generalizations that lack a meaningful connection to the statistical quantities they are putatively based on. I argue that failure to take the alignment between verbal and statistical expressions seriously lies at the heart of many of psychology's ongoing problems (e.g., the replication crisis), and conclude with a discussion of several potential avenues for improvement.},

We propose a simple model that converts this anomalous ; error variance" into sources of substantive insight into the nature of public opinion. The model abandons the conventional but implausible notion that most people possess opinions at the level of specificity of typical survey items-and instead assumes that most people are internally conflicted over most political issues-and that most respond to survey questions on the basis of whatever ideas are at the top of their heads at the moment of answering. Numerous empirical regularities are shown to be consistent with these assumptions. Virtually},
